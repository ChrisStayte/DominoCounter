    "# Image Curation\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "I have a folder with images that need annotations. In order to keep them organized I would like to name them 01 -> (n). The file types can be (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, and .webp). I would also like to maintain the order of already sorted images in the event that I add additional images to the collection.\n",
